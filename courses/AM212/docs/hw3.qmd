# Drunk Problem

The diffusion or people leaving a bar on a 1-dimensional street is modeled using the 1-d forced diffusion equation:

$$\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2p}{\partial x^2} + S(x, t) \\
p(x, 0) = 0 \\
\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}(0, t) = \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}(L, t) = 0
\end{cases}$${#eq-forceddiff}

where $p$ is the probability density of drunk people, $S(x, t)$ is the 'source' of drunk people per unit time coming into the street at position $x$.

To model the exit of the pub the forcing equation is such that:

$$	S(x, t) = S_0 \delta(x - \frac{L}{2})e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}} \quad \text{for } t > 0$${#eq-forcing}

where $\tau$ is the characteristic time scale.

## Part A

Use dimensional analysis to find the characteristic diffusion timescale of the problem in the absense of forcing, $\tau_D$
