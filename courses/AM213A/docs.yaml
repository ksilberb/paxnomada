- title: Midterm Exam
  description: "This midterm exam covers seven main areas: definitions of fundamental linear algebra concepts like matrix rank, orthogonality, SVD, eigenvalues, and numerical stability; proving that real symmetric matrices are diagonalizable using Schur decomposition; analyzing the Cholesky decomposition method for solving normal equations and its numerical issues with ill-conditioned matrices; proving eigenvalue bounds for stochastic matrices and invertibility conditions; examining properties of symmetric positive definite matrices including eigenvalue positivity; analyzing Gaussian elimination without pivoting, counting its operations, identifying numerical issues, and describing partial pivoting as a solution; and studying an iterative algorithm involving Cholesky decomposition, proving invariant properties, similarity transformations, and computing explicit iterations."

- title: Final Coding Project
  description: "This final coding project requires students to implement two main problems: SVD-based image compression using LAPACK routines to compress a black-and-white dog image at various singular value levels and visualize the results, and iterative linear algebra methods including Gauss-Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel algorithms to solve systems of equations, with an optional conjugate gradient implementation for extra credit."
