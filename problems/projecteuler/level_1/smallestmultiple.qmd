## Problem definition

$2520$ is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from $1$ to $10$ without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that can is **evenly divisible** by all of the numbers from $1$ to $20$?


## Solution

```{julia}
function isDivisible(num::Int)
    r::Int = 0
    for i = 1:20
        r = mod(num, i)
        if r != 0
            return false
        end
    end
    return true
end

function main()
    current = 2520
    while !(isDivisible(current))
        current += 1
    end
    current
end
main()
```
