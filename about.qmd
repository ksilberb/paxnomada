# About

## Introduction

I'm Kevin Andrew Silberberg, a recent graduate from the Scientific Computing and Applied Math Master's program at [University of California Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/).

## About This Website

This website serves as my consolidated online presence, moving away from mainstream social media as the primary medium of my digital identity. I've designed it to be a focused space for learning, documenting, and sharing my work and thoughts.

Every document accessible on this website was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) markdown in an Emacs environment and published on GitHub Pages. I've found this workflow particularly rewarding for technical documentation, coding projects, and academic work.

### What You'll Find Here

- **[Stream](stream.qmd)**: My personal blog where I share thoughts, projects, and insights

- **[Photos](photos/index.qmd)**: A visual blog featuring photography from my travels and daily life, with dedicated sections for specific trips and a continuous stream of recent photos
