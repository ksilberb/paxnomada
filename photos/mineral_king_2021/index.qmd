When you get to [sawtooth trail head](https://www.nps.gov/places/000/sawtooth-trailhead.htm) you need to cover your vehicle to protect it from marmots... apparently they like to chew on the rubber hoses in the engine bay. I think we are just talking about the drive and catching up here.

Obligatory group photo! Esteban brought one of his coworkers and she had never backpacked before.

Jameson joined us! He met up with us as we were setting up camp at Pinto Lake. I vaguely remember him pulling a CAST IRON PAN out of his bag...
